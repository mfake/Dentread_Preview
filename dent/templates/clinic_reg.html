            These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;, &ldquo;Terms of
            Service&rdquo;) govern your use of our website located at

          </p>
  
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains

            Service (&ldquo;Purchase&rdquo;), you may be asked to supply certain
            information relevant to your Purchase including but not limited to,
            your credit or debit card number, the expiration date of your card,
            your billing address, and your shipping information.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use
            any card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any
            Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true,

          </p>
  
          <p>
            We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of

          <p class="change_para">4. Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</p>
  
          <p>
            Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively,
            &ldquo;Promotions&rdquo;) made available through Service may be
            governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If
            you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules
            as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict
            with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.
          </p>
  
          <p class="change_para">5. Subscriptions</p>
  
          <p>
            Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis
            (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a
            recurring and periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing
            cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you
            select when purchasing a Subscription.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
            renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Dentread
            cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
            your online account management page or by contacting info@dentread.com
            customer support team.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your
            subscription. You shall provide Dentread with accurate and complete
            billing information that may include but not limited to full name,
            address, state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid
            payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
            you automatically authorize Dentread to charge all Subscription fees
            incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Dentread
            reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service with
            immediate effect.
          </p>
  
          <p class="change_para">6. Free Trial</p>
  
          <p>
            Dentread may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
            trial for a limited period of time (&quot;Free Trial&quot;).
          </p>
  
          <p>
            You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign
            up for Free Trial.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free
            Trial, you will not be charged by Dentread until Free Trial has
            expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled
            your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable
            Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            At any time and without notice, Dentread reserves the right to (i)
            modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free
            Trial offer.
          </p>
  
          <p class="change_para">7. Fee Changes</p>
  
          <p>
            Dentread, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
            Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
            will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Dentread will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change
            in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
            Subscription before such change becomes effective.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into
            effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee
            amount.
          </p>
  
          <p class="change_para">8. Refunds</p>

            of the Contract.

          <p class="change_para">5. Subscriptions</p>
  
          <p>
            Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis
            (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a
            recurring and periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing
            cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you
            select when purchasing a Subscription.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
            renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Dentread
            cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
            your online account management page or by contacting info@dentread.com
            customer support team.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your
            subscription. You shall provide Dentread with accurate and complete
            billing information that may include but not limited to full name,
            address, state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid
            payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
            you automatically authorize Dentread to charge all Subscription fees
            incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Dentread

          <p class="change_para">6. Free Trial</p>
  
          <p>
            Dentread may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
            trial for a limited period of time (&quot;Free Trial&quot;).
          </p>
  
          <p>
            You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign
            up for Free Trial.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free
            Trial, you will not be charged by Dentread until Free Trial has
            expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled
            your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable
            Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            At any time and without notice, Dentread reserves the right to (i)
            modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free
            Trial offer.

          <p class="change_para">7. Fee Changes</p>
  
          <p>
            Dentread, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
            Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
            will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Dentread will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change
            in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
            Subscription before such change becomes effective.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into
            effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee
            amount.
