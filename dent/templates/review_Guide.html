                                                to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they
                                                are binding on you.

                                                By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become
                                                effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not

                                                No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
                                                be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or
                                                a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to
                                                assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver
                                                of such right or provision.

                                                reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
                                                extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in
