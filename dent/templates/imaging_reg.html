If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.</p>

<p class="change_para">5. Subscriptions</p>

<p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Dentread cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting info@dentread.com customer support team.</p>

<p>A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Dentread with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full name, address, state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Dentread to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
